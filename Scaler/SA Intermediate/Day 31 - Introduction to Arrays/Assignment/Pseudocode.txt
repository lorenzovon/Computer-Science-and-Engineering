Q5. Array Rotation

Given an integer array A of size N and an integer B, you have to return the same array after rotating it B times towards the right.

Approach
If array is 
a1, a2, a3, a4, ......., an-k-1, an-k, .........., an 
It will become 
an, an-1, .........., an-k, a1, a2, ............, an-k-1
This can be achieved by first 
Reversing the entire array
next -> Reverse from 1 to n-k-1 and from n-k till n
